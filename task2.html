 <h1><strong><p style="text-align: center;">JHANSI RANI</strong></h1><br>
 <p><p "style=text-align:center;">
<p Jhansi city, situated between the rivers Pahunj and Betwa is a symbol of bravery, courage and self respect. It is said that in ancient times Jhansi was a part of the regions Chedi Rashtra, Jejak Bhukit, Jajhoti and Bundelkhand. Jhansi was a stronghold of the Chandela kings. Balwant Nagar was the name of this place</p><br>
Rani Lakshmibai fought bravely against the British so as to save her empire from annexation. She died fighting on the battlefield on 17th June 1858. When the Indian National Army started its first female unit (in 1943), it was named after the valiant queen of jhansi.<br>
Born into a Karhada Brahmin family in Banares, Lakshmibai married the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao, in 1842. When the Maharaja died in 1853, the British East India Company under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie refused to recognize the claim of his adopted heir and annexed Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse. The Rani was unwilling to cede control and joined the rebellion against the British in 1857. She led the successful defense of Jhansi against Company allies, but in early 1858 Jhansi fell to British forces under the command of Hugh Rose. The Rani managed to escape on horseback and joined the rebels in capturing Gwalior, where they proclaimed Nana Saheb as Peshwa of the revived Maratha Empire. She died in June 1858 after being mortally wounded during the British counterattack<br>
